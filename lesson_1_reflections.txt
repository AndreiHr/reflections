How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showcased where exactly are the differences between two versions, in order for the bugs to pe spotted more easily
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I would compare problems that may arise over the long haul 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It is somehow subjective and it may be detrimental to your project if you do not take into account all the changes
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is programming oriented, so programs are bound to be interconnected
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log shows me the commits while git diff exhibits the differences
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It would certainly help me in dealing with bugs I did not recognised and I could make changes without putting in peril the whole project
